# Food Systems Sustainability Meta-Framework (FSSMF)

## Description

FSSMF outlines the tenets (grounding elements) of food systems sustainability, that each framework necessarily needs to consider for consistently accounting for it. FSSMF Tenets cover Pillars and Stocks of Essential Relations pertaining to food systems sustainability. FSSMF Pillars and Stocks stand as orthogonal to existing food systems sustainability frameworks.

Pillars count for three:

1.	The perspectives of food systems stakeholders.
2.	The complexity of food systems.
3.	The transformation of food systems.
   
The stocks count for two:

1.	Domain-Neutral Relations (DNRs).
2.	Domain Relations (DRs).

See the article referred to in the "publication and documentation" section of this repository for details.
   
This repository maintains the FSSMF Atlas, a series of graphical nodes-and-edges-based illustrations (Charts), structuring the FSSMF vocabulary. Currently, FSSMF adopts the [OBO-Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/) perspective of ontological realism (see for instance [Arp et al. (2015)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262527811/building-ontologies-with-basic-formal-ontology/) and [Smith and Ceusters (2010)](https://philarchive.org/rec/SMIORA-2)). FSSMF Atlas versions adopting alternative ontological perspectives will come soon.

## Material

Currently, this repository hosts the FSSMF Atlas charts. 

FSSMF Atlas charts count for four:

1. [The Main Chart (Atlas-MC).](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Food-Systems-Sustainability-Meta-Framework-FSSMF/tree/6e6667760ddf6740965c12d15c5a47f75dbbd4ac/FSSMF%20Altas-MC)
2. [The Auxiliary Chart 1 (Atlas-AC1).](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Food-Systems-Sustainability-Meta-Framework-FSSMF/tree/59c92ea17c6f156c860635e511304c48a8104841/FSSMF%20Altas-AC1)
3. [The Auxiliary Chart 2 (Atlas-AC2).](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Food-Systems-Sustainability-Meta-Framework-FSSMF/tree/3b1583cb8070010cb4c521c88aaeb9ecb809a087/FSSMF%20Altas-AC2)
4. [The Auxiliary Chart 3 (Atlas-AC3).](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Food-Systems-Sustainability-Meta-Framework-FSSMF/tree/a773f6438fa9aa20e02f63a9944de1d135044998/FSSMF%20Altas-AC3)
   
Atlas-MC extends FSSMF vocabularies from [Sustainability Core Ontology (SCO)](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/The-List-of-Sustainability-Ontologies.git) and [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020.git). Each auxiliary map outlines the vocabulary primarily relating to one of the three pillars. The auxiliary charts also provide links to external literature resources.

The article referred to in the "publication and documentation" section of this repository presents the methodology employed to construct FSSMF Atlas Charts.

FSSMF Atlas charts are available in [CXL format](https://cmap.ihmc.us/xml/cxl.html) and PDF format. We suggest downloading and exploring FSSMF Atlas charts with [CmapTools](https://cmap.ihmc.us/) (Version 6.03), the software used to create them. FSSMF Atlas charts should be imported locally or in Cmap cloud. Additional and novel environments for navigation, visualization, and retrieval of FSSMF charts will come soon.

## Ontologies Constructed on the Basis of FSSMF

The following ontologies have been developed employing FSSMF:

- [Sustainable Meat Systems Ontology (SuMSO)](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainable-Meat-Systems-Ontology)
